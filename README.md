## 🔷 Meet JUNO: A New Kind of Intelligence in the JIRA Family

If JIRA is the powerhouse of project and issue tracking, JUNO is its smarter, more intuitive cousin—built not to replace, but to extend and elevate how teams interact with JIRA.

Where JIRA organizes data, JUNO understands it.
Where JIRA tracks tasks, JUNO tells the story behind them.
Where JIRA requires clicks and filters, JUNO listens to your words and delivers insights.

Born from the same mission of empowering software teams, JUNO steps in to make JIRA more human:

*   **Ask JUNO in plain language:** “How’s sprint velocity trending this quarter?” or “Who’s overloaded?”
*   She connects directly to JIRA’s API, analyzes the data, and delivers clear, conversational, customized reports.
*   Powered by Enterprise GPT and a native understanding of project structures, JUNO bridges human intent with operational clarity.

JUNO doesn’t replace JIRA. She translates it.

Together, they form a seamless, intelligent ecosystem:

**JIRA handles the execution. JUNO handles the explanation.**
