## Implementation Roadmap for Human Evaluation

The implementation of JUNO's human evaluation framework requires a structured approach that scales with the system's evolution through its four phases. This roadmap provides engineering teams with clear guidance for establishing evaluation capabilities that grow alongside JUNO's increasing autonomy and sophistication.

### Phase 1 Implementation: Foundation Evaluation

During Phase 1, evaluation focuses on establishing baseline capabilities and validating JUNO's fundamental analytics functions. The evaluation team at this stage consists primarily of data analysts and business stakeholders who can assess the accuracy and relevance of JUNO's insights.

**Week 1-2: Team Formation and Training**
- Identify and recruit Triage QA specialists with deep understanding of issue prioritization
- Establish Sprint Coach roles with expertise in team dynamics and workflow optimization
- Provide initial training on JUNO capabilities and evaluation methodologies
- Create evaluation documentation templates and procedures

**Week 3-4: Baseline Establishment**
- Implement automated LLM judges for routine analytics validation
- Establish performance baselines for data accuracy and report quality
- Create feedback collection mechanisms for end users
- Begin daily monitoring and weekly review cycles

**Week 5-8: Iterative Refinement**
- Analyze initial evaluation results and identify improvement opportunities
- Refine evaluation criteria based on actual JUNO performance patterns
- Adjust automated judge thresholds and human review triggers
- Document lessons learned and best practices

### Phase 2 Implementation: Autonomous Decision Evaluation

Phase 2 evaluation expands to assess JUNO's autonomous decision-making capabilities, requiring more sophisticated evaluation frameworks and additional expertise in AI system behavior assessment.

**Month 1: Enhanced Evaluation Capabilities**
- Recruit domain experts with expertise in security, compliance, and technical standards

- Assess long-term impact on organizational objectives and productivity
- Evaluate return on investment and total cost of ownership
- Maintain strategic alignment as organizational needs evolve

## Conclusion: The Strategic Value of Proper Evaluation

The distinction between AI agents and agentic AI represents more than a semantic difference—it reflects fundamental differences in system capabilities, operational approaches, and business value delivery. JUNO's positioning as agentic AI, supported by comprehensive human evaluation frameworks, provides organizations with the confidence and oversight necessary to realize the full potential of autonomous AI systems.

The evaluation frameworks outlined in this guide recognize that agentic AI systems like JUNO operate with inherent variability and adaptability that traditional software testing cannot adequately assess. By focusing on outcomes rather than processes, while maintaining attention to reasoning quality and ethical alignment, these frameworks provide the oversight necessary for successful AI integration.

As JUNO evolves through its phases from analytics foundation to AI-native operations, the evaluation framework evolves alongside it, ensuring that increased autonomy translates into increased value delivery while maintaining appropriate human oversight and organizational alignment. This approach positions organizations to confidently embrace the transformative potential of agentic AI while maintaining the governance and accountability essential for enterprise success.

The comprehensive nature of this evaluation framework, combining automated assessment with human judgment, provides the foundation for JUNO's successful integration into enterprise environments. By understanding and implementing these evaluation approaches, engineering teams can ensure that JUNO delivers on its promise of intelligent, autonomous, and valuable AI assistance that truly enhances rather than disrupts organizational effectiveness.
