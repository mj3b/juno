## Jira Cloud REST API v3 - Key Endpoints and Capabilities

### General API Features:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Supports OAuth 2.0 (3LO) and basic authentication. Permissions are granular and can be assigned to groups, project roles, or individual users.
- **Expansion**: Allows retrieval of additional related data (e.g., names, renderedFields) within a single request using the `expand` query parameter.
- **Pagination**: Results are paginated to improve performance, with `startAt`, `maxResults`, `total`, and `isLast` fields for navigation.
- **Ordering**: Supports ordering of results by specific fields using the `orderBy` query parameter.
- **Timestamps**: Uses ISO 8601 format for timestamps.

### Key Endpoints for Data Extraction:

#### 1. Ticket Data (Issues):
- **GET /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}**: Retrieve a specific issue by ID or key. Supports expansion of various fields.
- **GET /rest/api/3/search**: Search for issues using JQL (Jira Query Language). This is a powerful endpoint for filtering and retrieving specific sets of tickets based on complex criteria. It supports pagination and ordering.
- **GET /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/transitions**: Get possible transitions for an issue.
- **GET /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comments**: Get comments for an issue.
- **GET /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/remotelink**: Get remote links for an issue.

#### 2. User Data:
- **GET /rest/api/3/user**: Search for users. Can be filtered by account ID, email, or username.
- **GET /rest/api/3/user/{accountId}**: Get a specific user by account ID.
- **GET /rest/api/3/myself**: Get information about the currently authenticated user.

#### 3. Custom Fields:
- **GET /rest/api/3/field**: Get all custom fields and their configurations. This is crucial for understanding the available custom metrics.
- Custom field values are typically returned within the issue object when retrieving issue data. The API documentation indicates that `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content directly, which is important for data extraction.

### Potential for Granular Reporting:
- The `/rest/api/3/search` endpoint with JQL allows for highly granular filtering of issues, enabling reports based on assignee, status, project, custom fields, and more.
- The ability to expand fields within issue objects means that detailed information about each ticket, including custom field values, can be retrieved efficiently.
- Access to user data allows for reports on assignee ticket counts and other user-centric metrics.
- The `/rest/api/3/field` endpoint provides the metadata needed to interpret and utilize custom fields in reports.

This API provides a robust foundation for building an AI agent capable of generating customized and granular reports from Jira data.
