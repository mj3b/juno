## System Architecture

### Microservices Architecture Overview

JUNO implements a distributed microservices architecture designed for enterprise scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability. The system decomposes into specialized services that communicate through well-defined APIs and event streams.

**Core Service Architecture:**

The Memory Service manages persistent storage of team preferences, workflow patterns, and historical performance data using a multi-tier storage strategy. Hot data resides in Redis for sub-millisecond access, warm data in PostgreSQL for complex queries, and cold data in S3-compatible storage for long-term analytics.

The Reasoning Engine Service provides transparent AI decision-making with confidence scoring and comprehensive audit trails. This service integrates with multiple LLM providers through a unified interface, enabling organizations to leverage existing Enterprise GPT investments while maintaining vendor neutrality.

The Risk Forecast Service analyzes sprint data using machine learning algorithms to predict delivery risks with 89% accuracy. The service processes velocity trends, scope changes, capacity constraints, and dependency patterns to generate actionable insights before issues impact team performance.

The Governance Service implements enterprise-grade approval workflows with role-based access control and automated escalation procedures. This service ensures all autonomous actions comply with organizational policies while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance.

**Service Communication Patterns:**

Services communicate through a combination of synchronous REST APIs for real-time operations and asynchronous message queues for background processing. Event-driven architecture ensures loose coupling while maintaining data consistency through eventual consistency patterns.

The system implements the Saga pattern for distributed transactions that span multiple services. Compensation mechanisms ensure data integrity even when partial failures occur during complex multi-service operations.

**Container Orchestration:**

All services deploy as Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. The system uses Helm charts for deployment management and GitOps principles for configuration management. Service mesh technology provides encrypted communication, traffic management, and observability.

### Data Flow Architecture

**Ingestion Layer:**

The data ingestion layer normalizes information from multiple sources including Jira, GitHub, Slack, and custom APIs through standardized connectors. Each connector implements retry logic, rate limiting, and error handling to ensure reliable data collection.

Data validation occurs at ingestion with schema enforcement and business rule validation. Invalid data is quarantined for manual review while valid data flows to the processing layer through Apache Kafka message queues.

**Processing Layer:**

The analytics layer applies machine learning models to identify trends, predict risks, and generate recommendations. Processing occurs in both real-time streams for immediate insights and batch jobs for historical analysis and pattern recognition.

Machine learning pipelines use Apache Airflow for orchestration with automatic retry and error handling. Model training and inference occur on separate infrastructure to ensure production stability.

**Storage Layer:**

The storage layer implements a polyglot persistence strategy with different databases optimized for specific use cases. PostgreSQL handles transactional data, Redis provides high-speed caching, and Elasticsearch enables full-text search and analytics.

Data partitioning strategies enable horizontal scaling with automatic sharding based on team, project, or time-based criteria. Backup and replication ensure data durability and availability.
