## Evaluation Methodology Framework

### Core Principles

**Outcome-Focused Assessment**
JUNO evaluation prioritizes outcome achievement over process adherence, recognizing that agentic AI systems can reach the same objectives through different valid approaches. This principle acknowledges that JUNO's adaptive capabilities may lead to solutions that differ from predetermined workflows while still delivering appropriate business value.

**Multi-Layered Validation**
The evaluation framework operates on three distinct levels: automated assessment for routine operations, human oversight for complex scenarios, and strategic governance for organizational alignment. This layered approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

**Continuous Learning Integration**
Evaluation results feed back into JUNO's learning systems and organizational processes, creating a continuous improvement cycle that enhances both AI capabilities and evaluation effectiveness over time.
