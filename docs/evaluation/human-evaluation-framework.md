# JUNO Human Evaluation Framework

## Executive Summary

The evaluation of agentic AI systems like JUNO requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional software testing. Unlike conventional applications with predetermined execution paths, JUNO agents can achieve the same objectives through multiple valid routes, making standard evaluation methodologies inadequate. This framework establishes a comprehensive human evaluation system that combines automated LLM judges for scalable assessment with human reviewers for edge cases, focusing on outcome achievement through reasonable processes rather than rigid path adherence.

## The Challenge of Evaluating Agentic AI

Traditional software evaluation relies on deterministic testing where specific inputs produce predictable outputs through known execution paths. However, agentic AI systems like JUNO operate with inherent variability in their decision-making processes. A JUNO agent tasked with resolving sprint risks might choose to reassign tickets, adjust sprint scope, or escalate to stakeholders - all potentially valid approaches depending on context. This variability necessitates evaluation frameworks that assess outcomes and reasoning quality rather than process conformity.

The complexity increases across JUNO's four phases. Phase 1 analytics agents follow relatively predictable patterns, but Phase 4 AI-native operations involve sophisticated multi-agent coordination with emergent behaviors that cannot be fully anticipated during design. Human evaluation becomes essential for validating that these emergent behaviors align with organizational objectives and maintain appropriate boundaries.

## JUNO Human Evaluation Architecture

### Evaluation Hierarchy

The JUNO evaluation framework operates on three distinct levels, each requiring different combinations of automated and human assessment. The foundation level employs automated LLM judges for high-volume, routine evaluations. The oversight level introduces human reviewers for complex scenarios and edge cases. The governance level provides strategic evaluation of JUNO's overall impact and alignment with organizational goals.

**Foundation Level: Automated LLM Judges**

Automated evaluation handles the majority of JUNO's routine operations through specialized LLM judges trained on JUNO-specific evaluation criteria. These judges assess whether JUNO's actions align with established patterns and achieve expected outcomes within acceptable parameters. For Phase 1 analytics operations, automated judges evaluate report accuracy, data interpretation quality, and recommendation relevance. The automated system processes thousands of JUNO interactions daily, flagging anomalies for human review while validating standard operations.

**Oversight Level: Human Reviewers**

Human reviewers, designated as JUNO Supervisors, provide critical evaluation for complex scenarios, edge cases, and situations requiring contextual judgment that exceeds automated capabilities. These supervisors include specialized roles such as Triage QA specialists who evaluate JUNO's issue prioritization decisions, and Sprint Coaches who assess workflow optimization recommendations. Human reviewers focus on outcome appropriateness, reasoning transparency, and alignment with team dynamics that automated systems cannot fully comprehend.

**Governance Level: Strategic Evaluation**

Strategic evaluation involves senior stakeholders assessing JUNO's broader organizational impact, including productivity improvements, team satisfaction, and alignment with business objectives. This level evaluates whether JUNO's evolution across phases delivers promised value and maintains appropriate human-AI collaboration boundaries.
