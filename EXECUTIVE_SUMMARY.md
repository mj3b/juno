# JUNO: The Analyst Your Engineers Have Been Waiting For
## Executive 1-Pager

### ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem: Engineering Intelligence Gap**

**Engineering teams are drowning in data but starving for insights.**

- **Context Switching Overload** - Engineers spend 40% of their time navigating between tools
- **Data Silos** - Critical insights trapped in complex Jira queries and dashboards  
- **Reactive Management** - Teams discover problems after they become critical
- **Manual Reporting** - Hours wasted on repetitive data extraction and analysis

**The Cost:** Reduced velocity, missed deadlines, and frustrated teams.

---

### ðŸš€ **The Vision: InsightOps Through Natural Language**

**JUNO transforms how engineering teams interact with their data.**

Instead of learning complex JQL or navigating multiple dashboards, teams simply ask:

> *"How's our velocity trending this quarter?"*  
> *"Which components have the highest defect rates?"*  
> *"Who's overloaded and needs support?"*

JUNO understands context, provides insights, and guides decision-makingâ€”like having a dedicated data analyst embedded in your team.
