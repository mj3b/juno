# Todo List

## Phase 1: Research and analyze JIRA API capabilities and enterprise reporting requirements
- [x] Research JIRA Cloud REST API documentation
- [x] Identify key endpoints for ticket data, user data, and custom fields
- [x] Research common enterprise reporting requirements for software engineering departments (e.g., defect patterns, velocity, lead time, cycle time, burndown/burnup charts)
- [x] Investigate existing JIRA integrations and their reporting capabilities
- [x] Summarize findings on JIRA API limitations and potential workarounds

## Phase 2: Design the AI agent architecture and natural language interface
- [x] Define the core components of the AI agent (e.g., Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module, JIRA API Connector, Data Processing Engine, Reporting/Visualization Module)
- [x] Outline the data flow and interaction between these components
- [x] Design the natural language interface: specify input format, expected user queries, and desired output format
- [x] Consider potential challenges and solutions for natural language processing of technical JIRA terms and reporting metrics
- [x] Document the architectural design and interface specifications
## Phase 3: Implement JIRA API integration and data extraction modules
- [x] Set up the project structure for the AI agent
- [x] Implement the JIRA API Connector module with authentication and basic API calls
- [x] Create data models for JIRA entities (issues, users, projects, custom fields)
- [x] Implement data extraction functions for common JIRA data (issues, users, custom fields metadata)
- [x] Add error handling and rate limiting for API calls
- [x] Test the JIRA API integration with sample data
## Phase 4: Build natural language processing and query interpretation system
- [x] Implement intent recognition for common Jira reporting queries
- [x] Create entity extraction for Jira-specific terms (projects, users, statuses, etc.)
- [x] Build query normalization and JQL generation from natural language
- [x] Implement context-aware query processing
- [x] Add support for complex queries with multiple conditions
- [x] Test the NLP system with various query types
## Phase 5: Develop advanced analytics and reporting engines
- [x] Implement velocity and sprint analytics (story points, completion rates, burndown/burnup)
- [x] Create defect pattern analysis and quality metrics
- [x] Build lead time and cycle time analytics
- [x] Develop trend analysis and forecasting capabilities
- [x] Implement advanced filtering and aggregation functions
- [x] Create data visualization generation (charts, graphs, dashboards)
- [x] Add export capabilities (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- [x] Test analytics engines with sample data
## Phase 6: Create web interface and visualization dashboard
- [x] Create React frontend application with modern UI design
- [x] Implement natural language query interface
- [x] Build analytics dashboard with interactive charts
- [x] Create project selection and configuration interface
- [x] Add real-time data visualization and updates
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Add export and sharing capabilities
- [x] Test the complete web interface
## Phase 7: Test the complete system and prepare deployment
- [x] Test Flask backend API endpoints
- [x] Test frontend-backend integration
- [x] Verify all analytics and NLP functionality
- [x] Test the complete user workflow
- [x] Prepare deployment configurations
- [x] Create production build of frontend
- [x] Test deployed system functionality
- [x] Document any deployment requirements
## Phase 9: Integrate with Enterprise GPT (OpenAI) for enhanced NLP
- [x] Research OpenAI Enterprise GPT API capabilities and integration options
- [x] Design integration architecture for enhanced natural language processing
- [x] Implement OpenAI API integration with secure authentication
- [x] Enhance NLP processor to leverage GPT models for improved query understanding
- [x] Add advanced conversation capabilities and context awareness
- [x] Implement intelligent query suggestions and auto-completion
- [x] Test enhanced NLP capabilities with complex queries
- [x] Update documentation with OpenAI integration details
